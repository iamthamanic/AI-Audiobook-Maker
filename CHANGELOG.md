### Fixed
- **Fish Speech TTS**: Completely resolved tokenizer and model configuration issues
  - Fixed missing `tokenizer.tiktoken` file with proper base64 encoding of 32,000 tokens
  - Created correct `firefly_gan_vq.yaml` configuration matching firefly-gan-vq-fsq-4x1024 model
  - Resolved PyTorch model dimension mismatches (512-dim vs 1024-dim)
  - Fixed ServeTTSRequest parameter validation (`use_memory_cache` format)
  - Fish Speech now loads successfully and is fully operational

### Improved
- **Fish Speech Reliability**: Complete end-to-end functionality restoration
  - Text-to-semantic model loads without errors
  - Decoder model loads with correct architecture configuration
  - TTS inference engine initializes properly
  - Service availability detection works correctly

### Technical Details
- Fixed tokenizer conversion from JSON to tiktoken format with base64 encoding
- Created custom firefly_gan_vq.yaml config with 512-dim input to match model architecture
- Updated FishSpeechService.js parameter format for Fish Speech API compatibility
- All Fish Speech dependencies and imports now function correctly
